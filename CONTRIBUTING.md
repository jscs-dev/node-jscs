Contribution Guide
==================

This document describes some points about contribution process for jscs package.

The maintainers of the project are:
 * Marat Dulin (@mdevils).
 * Oleg Gaidarenko (@markelog).
 * Mike Sherov (@mikesherov).

The project is being developed within community. Maintainer merges pull-requests, fixes critical bugs.

Pull-requests
-------------

If you fixed or added something useful to the project, you can send pull-request.
It will be reviewed by maintainer and accepted, or commented for rework, or declined.

Bugs
----

If you found an error, typo or any other flaw in the project,
please report about it using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs/issues).
The more details you provide, the easier it could be reproduced and the faster it could be fixed.
Unfortunately, sometimes the bug can only be reproduced in your project or in your environment,
so maintainers cannot reproduce it. In this case we believe you can fix the bug and send us the fix.

Features
--------

It you've got an idea about a new feature, it's most likely that you'll have to implement it on your own.
If you cannot implement the feature, but it is very important, you can create an issue at GitHub,
but expect it to be declined by the maintainer.

Presets
-------

If you'd like to add an additional preset, please add the following:

* The new preset's configuration to `/presets`
* A JS file containing sample source code (ideally from that organization/project's codebase) to `/test/data/options/preset/`
* An integration test by adding the line `testPreset('mynewpreset');` to `/test/options/preset.js`
